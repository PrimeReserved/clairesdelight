# Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Using Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensuring proper communication between components.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Using Cypress for simulating user scenarios.

## Jest Testing Library

Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript applications, developed by Facebook.
It provides a lot of features out of the box, such as:

- **Zero-configuration testing**: Jest automatically finds and runs tests in your project.
- **Mocking**: Jest allows you to mock out dependencies and modules, making it easier to isolate and test individual components.
- **Code coverage**: Jest provides code coverage reports, helping you identify untested areas of your code.
- **Parallel testing**: Jest runs tests in parallel, speeding up the testing process.

Jest is widely used in the JavaScript community and is often used in conjunction with other popular frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js.
