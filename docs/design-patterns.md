# Design Pattern

## design patterns mentioned earlier:

### Next.js for MVC Structure:

- App: Next.js app can act as your Views, representing the different screens (landing page, product listings, spice details) of your application.

- API routes: Define your application logic (Model) within Next.js API routes. These routes can handle data fetching, user authentication, and other server-side operations.

- Components: Utilize Next.js components to build reusable UI elements for your Views, promoting modularity and code maintainability.

### Data Fetching and Repository Pattern:

- getS: Next.js provides these functions to fetch spice data from your data source (database, API) at build time (getStaticProps) or on each request (getServerSideProps). This aligns with the Repository pattern's data access abstraction.

### Next.js for Facade Pattern and User Interaction:

- Custom Hooks: Create custom hooks to encapsulate complex functionalities like spice filtering logic. This can simplify your components and provide a clean interface for filtering (similar to the Facade pattern).

- Client-side routing: Next.js enables client-side routing for a smooth user experience when filtering or navigating between spice details.

### Next.js considerations for SPA:

Next.js can be configured for a more SPA-like experience by leveraging features like dynamic routing and client-side data fetching. However, be mindful of potential SEO implications and choose the approach that best suits your needs.
